Atitit about democracy not for China


If American democracy is not suitable for China, why is Russian communism suitable for China? ?
Was the autocracy of the Qing Dynasty also good? ?
Why Sun Yat-sen was the founding father, because he brought democracy from the United States and overthrew the Qing Dynasty. . . Why this time (when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown), American democracy is a good thing. .

Is China suitable for democracy? ? Still suitable for the Saudi monarchy? ? I think the regional test is better. Hong Kong and Taiwan are test fields for democracy. I think Taiwan is very good. It is a beacon of democracy and worthy of China's study. 
Atitit 关于民主不适合中国


如果美国的民主不适合中国，那么来自俄罗斯的共产主义为什么就适合中国了？？
清朝的专制是不是也很好呢？？
为什么孙中山是国父，因为他从美国带来了民主，推翻了清朝。。。为什么这个时候（推翻清朝的时候），美国式民主就是好东西了。。

中国适不适合民主？？还是适合沙特君主制？？我觉得分区测试比较好，香港，台湾就是民主的试验田，我认为台湾很好，是民主灯塔，值得中国学习。。
