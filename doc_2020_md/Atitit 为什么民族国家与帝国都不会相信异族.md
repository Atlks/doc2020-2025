Atitit 为什么民族国家与帝国都不会相信异族

血统关系远近造成的，，你不会吧遗产留给别人，自己的儿女是第一继承人。。国家也是，同族血缘关系近。。统治民族会把国家遗产留给自己血缘方面近的人。。

这是基因造成的。。


非我族类其心必异

Any nation-state，， established by a  main ethnic  nation ，，will never trust other ethnic minorities, especially the larger ethnic minorities, especially when they have their own nation-state abroad。。


Of course, on the surface it is politically correct and on the surface trust, but in the important field of national security, if you are not a ruling nation race, then you will not get the opportunity to enter the national security sector

 
For example, Singapore, a Malay, although he has Singaporean nationality, it is difficult for him to be allowed to enter the national security department and military department.
