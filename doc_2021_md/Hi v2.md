 Hi!                   


sorry because I'm so stubborn, sorry because I will let  my pride more than I should understand you. In fact, I just now realized that the responsibility I have to face is too big. I’ll admit to you that I didn’t know what to do. But right now I need to stand up for what I did, as much as I can I will be a good wife to you, I will understand you, respect you, follow you and take care of you. Maybe you are right that I am 25 years old which should be at this age I should be able to do a lot, especially for myself and  I really appreciated  that you told me this. I don't want us to always fight, I know we still have many bad sides that we need to adjust and understand. I am Filipina and you are Chinese and we may need a lot to adopt from each other especially with the different state of our lives, different beliefs and cultures. And who or what you are I will respect you. I know you don’t like the state of our lives and I understand you, because I don’t like this life either. But I don't want you to stop me from what I want to achieve in the future and I want you to understand that this dream is not just for me but for my son and family. I understand that you want to help me, but I will not accept your help for my family because you are not responsible for them. Don't worry because even if you don't help them, they will still respect you and consider you their family. All I want to happen is for you to fucos on our future, I want to have my own family and a good future and I have confidence in you that you can do it. Just remember you are not alone I am here to help you, I know you are more matured and more successful than me but I will still do my best to fulfill our dreams. This is all I ask for you to give me at least one more year before we get together. Let me finish my studies and pass my board examination first. And I promise you after that I will be free to come with you and I introduce you to my family. even if we are not together yet I will still fulfill my obligation to you as I say. If you need anything from me, just call me and I will come to you right away or when you ask me to do something, I will do it right away unless I have something important to do. Just in case there's something we don't understand, I want us to talk properly, I don't want us to fight and shout. If I have said something that hurts your feelings, tell me right away so that I can correct it, or if I have done something that you did not like, tell me right away so that I will not do it again. I want you to know that I am happy with you and I have not regretted marrying you because I know that you are a good person and responsible. ILOVE YOU !

MONIC
