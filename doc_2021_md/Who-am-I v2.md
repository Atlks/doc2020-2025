                                   Who am I  

I am Monica Estefane Vender , 26 years of age I was born on February 13 ,1995 at Sto Nino Sominot Zamboanga del sur Where in the province of Mindanao.  You can call me Monic , Mon or Ca. At age of 13 I was being separated with my family and I am starting live with my own and starting working to survive my life  so I grow up being independent . At age of 15 I took an examination for elementary level in ALS or ALTERNATIVE LEARNING SYSTEM and after 1 year I pass the examination and I am graduated in elementary . At age of 16 I’m studying in high school  until I reach the second year high school at age of 17. When I am second year I was falling in love with my classmates Jay  and he fall me too until we didn’t control ourself to make romance and then I got pregnant and my life became calvary. In the beginning we are both stress mostly on that time I am not matured enough to handle everything after nine months I gave birth I am so happy to see my baby boy especially he looks like me but when I see him I started thinking what kind of future I give to him  , I can’t even finish my high school and his father has no future at all. And then I started finding a job which is fit in my educational background and then I was started working as a house maid , sales lady in mini store and sari-sari store and it was year 2014 honestly it was not  easy because I need to work harder in order to support my son’s need including his diaper , vitamins ,milk and etc..  and while I am working Jay is the one who took care of our child because he is difficult to find a job due to his age and background so I am the one who work for us. After a year later I found out that Jay has an another woman and she’s our neighbor and when I found out the woman was pregnant and she wanted Jay to marry her, On that day I was very stress I felt insulted , I felt insecure , I felt pain and I don’t know what to do in the beginning I don’t want to let go Jay  I love him and I love my son I don’t want a broken family I’m willing to forgive him and forget all what is happened  but in the end he still choose this girl and then I decided to let him go. And I went back to my home town where in sominot Zamboanga del sur this is my first time coming home to my family since I left at the age of 13 years old. I will admit it was not easy for my family to accept me and my son, I even experienced beatings , slander and ridicule before they accept me. When my family accepted me they took care of my son and they helped me provide for his needs , until the day come that I did not expect my son got sick and I needed a lot of money for hospital bill and medicine so I was forced to work here in manila as a security guard  and  it was year 2016.  At first I was hurt and sad because that was the first time I would leave my son, I felt crazy especially when I remembered  his voice and cries and that time he was 1 years old and 8 months. After a month later I decided to take an examination again in ALS in order to finish my high school and then get  I review about six months and after six months I pass the examination and I am graduated in junior and senior high school then I enrolled in college so while I am working as a security guard in the morning then I will study at night until I finished my third year college and I am now working as secretary or assistant and still continuing my fourth year college and looking forward for my  goal. I am a busy woman I did not spent my time on party , hanging out with colleague and friends. I spend my time wisely  . I only spend my time for making money , family and sometimes meet up with my friend and I have only 4 friend. I am positively faces all the challenges that come on my way and I never give up until I did not accomplish my goal. 
When it comes to my hobbies I love reading , I love writing , I love watching movies like horror , action movies and documentary movies and I love spending my life of trying new things. I am good at analyzing and memorizing but I have a low self-stem when it comes to public speaking . I am organized and clean and I am a little bit stingy when it comes to money because I don’t want to spend money for nothing . I am a little bit shy especially when I am uncomfortable to a person or someone I meet or into a place, I am an introvert person I love being alone , I love being with myself. When it comes to relationship I am a little bit cold especially when I observed his negative behavior  and bad character.  I love simple , cute and kind person.  And I am a little bit picky when it comes to food.  When it comes to my appearance I am simple I do not want to put make up on my face because it makes me feel uncomfortable, I hate wearing skirt or high heel. I am confident for who I am and contented for what I have and what god gives me.  No one can’t change me , no one can’t stop me  I love being me and I don’t care what other people say about me as long as I have  nothing to do with them .
